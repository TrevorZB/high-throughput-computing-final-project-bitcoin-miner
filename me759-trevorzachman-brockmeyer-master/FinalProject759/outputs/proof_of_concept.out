############################### Proof of Concept ###############################
                                                                                
Will be testing our block header structure and hashing algorithm using the data 
present in the very first mined block of bitcoin. This block was mined on Jan   
9th, 2009. Data can be found here: 'https://explorer.btc.com/btc/block/1'       
                                                                                
First, we will see if our digest is the same as the one found in 2009.          
The actual hash found in 2009 was:                                              
000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
The hash calculated using our block head structure and hashing algorithm was:   
000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
Our digest is exactly the same as the one in calculated in 2009. This proves the
algorithms used by our miners are correct.                                      
                                                                                
Finally, for a bitcoin to be mined, our digest must be below a target value. We 
now check if our algorithm correctly finds the desired target and finds that our
digest is a value that is less than this target.                                
Our hash:                                                                       
000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
Calculated target:                                                              
00000000ffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Is the result digest found less than the target?                                
Yes
Our algorithm has successfully found our digest to be less than the target value
